# Responsive Portfolio Website: JavaScript and HTML

## Purpose of project

I wanted to create a responsive website from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.

- Show proficient with HTML/CSS
- To show my extensive JavaScript skills
- To demonstrate that I am able to create a responsive website
- Also, that I am able to implement third party tools
- Implemented [SuperSlides](https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides) to showcase full screen sliders
- Used [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) for the plugin to give a typing effect
- Used [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) for the plugin to give the skills section the scrolling effect and filling-in effect
- Also used [CountUp.js](https://github.com/inorganik/CountUp.js) for the counting up effect when a user scrolls to a set section
- Used [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to filter through my portfolio
- [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) added to view portfolio images
